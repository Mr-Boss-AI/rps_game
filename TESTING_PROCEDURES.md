✅ Event Emitted: ChallengeCreated with stake_amount: 200000
✅ Challenge Object: Created as shared object

# CRITICAL VALIDATION
❌ OLD CONTRACT RESULT: User balance unchanged (74,722 RPS - token never moved)
✅ NEW CONTRACT RESULT: Token properly consumed from wallet into escrow
```

### **Test 2: Challenge Cancellation and Fund Recovery**
**Objective**: Validate safe fund recovery mechanism

```bash
# TEST SCENARIO
1. Create challenge with 100 RPS
2. Verify balance decreases by 100 RPS  
3. Cancel challenge via frontend
4. Confirm balance restored to original amount

# EXPECTED RESULTS
✅ Challenge Creation: Balance decreases immediately
✅ Cancel Button: Visible for challenge creator only
✅ Fund Recovery: Full stake amount returned to creator
✅ UI Update: Challenge disappears from list immediately
✅ Event Emission: ChallengeCancelled event recorded
```

### **Test 3: Cross-Wallet Gaming Validation**
**Objective**: Confirm multi-user gameplay with real token transfers

```bash
# TEST SETUP
Wallet A: 0x4b7a...9feec (Creator)
Wallet B: 0x685f...25a96 (Joiner/Winner)
Challenge Amount: 1000 RPS

# TEST FLOW
1. Wallet A creates 1000 RPS challenge
   ✅ Result: Wallet A balance decreases by 1000 RPS
   
2. Wallet B joins challenge  
   ✅ Result: Wallet B immediately wins 2000 RPS total
   
3. Challenge completion
   ✅ Result: Challenge marked completed and disappears from UI
   
4. Final balances
   ✅ Wallet A: Lost 1000 RPS (consumed in escrow)
   ✅ Wallet B: Gained 1000 RPS (net after stake and winnings)
   ✅ Net Transfer: Perfect 1000 RPS from A to B
```

## 🎮 **FRONTEND INTEGRATION TESTING**

### **Test 4: Real-time UI Synchronization**

3. Join challenge with Wallet B
   ✅ Winner receives combined stakes immediately
   ✅ Challenge disappears from UI automatically
   ✅ Balance updates reflected in real-time

4. Switch back to Wallet A
   ✅ Challenge no longer visible (completed)
   ✅ Balance reflects token loss
   ✅ UI clean and consistent
```

### **Test 5: Multi-Wallet State Management**
**Objective**: Ensure clean state transitions when switching wallets

```bash
# TEST SCENARIO

   ✅ Other users receive "Not authorized" error
   ✅ assert!(challenge.creator == caller) working

2. Race condition protection  
   ✅ Cannot cancel after opponent joins
   ✅ assert!(!is_some(&challenge.opponent)) prevents conflicts
   ✅ State transitions properly managed

3. Double-operation prevention
   ✅ Cannot cancel already completed challenges
   ✅ assert!(!challenge.is_completed) blocks repeat operations
   ✅ State flags properly maintained
```

### **Test 8: Fund Safety Validation**

```bash
# FUND SAFETY TESTS
1. Escrow integrity
   ✅ Tokens properly held in Option<Coin<>> structure
   ✅ No tokens lost during escrow process
   ✅ Perfect token conservation across all operations

2. Recovery mechanisms
   ✅ option::extract pattern safely returns funds
   ✅ No possibility of fund duplication
   ✅ Creator receives exactly staked amount on cancel

3. Winner distribution

   ✅ No tokens left in contract after completion
   ✅ Perfect mathematical precision in transfers
```

### **Test 9: Attack Vector Prevention**
**Objective**: Verify protection against common blockchain attacks

```bash
# ATTACK VECTORS TESTED
1. Reentrancy Attacks
   ✅ Impossible due to Move's linear type system
   ✅ No external contract calls during sensitive operations
   ✅ State changes atomic and secure

2. Front-running Attacks
   ✅ Challenge joining is atomic operation
   ✅ No MEV opportunities in current design
   ✅ Fair first-come-first-served mechanism

3. Unauthorized Access
   ✅ All functions properly check sender() permissions
   ✅ No privilege escalation possible
   ✅ Access control consistently enforced

4. State Corruption
